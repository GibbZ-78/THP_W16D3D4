# REACT ESTATE

## Another (vain) attempt to have fun with React... Coding a real estate web agency

### :scroll: Content

This repository stores the result of a 2-day mini-project proposed on week #16 of the "Developer" curriculum, a 3-month web coding bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (THP, [https://www.thehackingproject.org/](https://www.thehackingproject.org/)).  
This project consists in instantiating, configuring and coding a SPA using React to more particularly dig into the following notions and features : state vars, context, routing, fragments, props, etc.

### :bulb: How to

1. Clone the current :octocat: repository to your local :computer: using something as simple as `git clone .`
2. Move to the just-brought-in directory
3. First make sure to install all dependencies via the `npm install` command, ran within this same cloned directory
4. Then launch the compiling of the different files as well as the Node web server by typing `npm start`
5. Wait... Wait again... Yes, I know, it is soooo long and sloooow
6. Still waiting? Congratulations! You should now see all builds passed and be able to browse [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
7. You can finally relax and - hopefully :sweat: - have fun surfing :surfer: and exploring :eyes: the React Estate web site
